# ✅ Deployment Configuration Complete

## What's Been Set Up

Your RealMaker app is now configured for Railway deployment! Here's what's ready:

### Configuration Files Created

1. **Client Configuration**

   - ✅ `client/nixpacks.toml` - Build and deployment config
   - ✅ `client/.railwayignore` - Files to exclude from deployment
   - ✅ `client/package.json` - Added `serve` package for hosting

2. **Server Configuration**

   - ✅ `server/nixpacks.toml` - Deno runtime and Prisma config
   - ✅ `server/.railwayignore` - Files to exclude from deployment

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ `README.md` - Project overview
   - ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
   - ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
   - ✅ `deploy-railway.sh` - Interactive deployment script

## Next Steps

### 1. Log in to Railway (Required)

```bash
railway login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with Railway.

### 2. Deploy Using the Helper Script (Recommended)

```bash
./deploy-railway.sh
```

Select option **1** for full deployment, which will:

- Create a Railway project
- Add PostgreSQL database
- Deploy your backend (Deno)
- Run database migrations
- Deploy your frontend (Expo Web)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, in the Railway dashboard:

**For the Frontend Service:**

- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your backend URL
  - Example: `https://realmaker-backend.up.railway.app`

**Backend automatically has:**

- `DATABASE_URL` (from PostgreSQL)
- `PORT` (set by Railway)

**If you need additional variables:**

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (for LLM features)
- Any other API keys your app uses

### 4. Redeploy Frontend After Setting Variables

```bash
cd client
railway up
```

## Project Structure

```
realmaker-app/
├── client/              # Expo web app
│   ├── nixpacks.toml   # ← Railway build config
│   └── dist/           # ← Generated after build
│
├── server/             # Deno backend
│   ├── nixpacks.toml  # ← Railway build config
│   └── prisma/        # Database schema
│
└── deploy-railway.sh  # ← Deployment helper
```

## Build Process

### Client (Expo Web)

1. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
2. Build: `npm run build:web` → outputs to `dist/`
3. Serve: `npx serve dist -s -p $PORT`

### Server (Deno)

1. Generate Prisma client: `deno task prisma:generate`
2. Start server: `deno task start`
3. Server runs on Railway's `$PORT`

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All services show "Active" in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Backend health endpoint responds
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Frontend can connect to backend
- [ ] Database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Not logged in to Railway CLI"

```bash
railway login
```

### "Module not found" or build errors

Check the logs:

```bash
railway logs
```

### Frontend can't connect to backend

Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set in the client service environment variables.

### Database connection errors

Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in the backend service.

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open

# Connect to PostgreSQL
railway connect postgres

# List environment variables
railway variables

# Update deployment
railway up
```

## Cost Estimate

Railway pricing:

- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month (great for testing)
- **Hobby**: $5/month + usage
- **Pro**: $20/month + usage

Estimated monthly cost for this setup:

- PostgreSQL: ~$5-10
- Backend (Deno): ~$5
- Frontend (Static): ~$0-2
- **Total**: ~$10-17/month on Hobby plan
